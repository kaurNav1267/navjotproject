		        <p>Your cover letter is the first thing employers see when you apply for a job. The content in your cover letter can help you stand out amongst other candidates. A cover letter isn't just a summary of your resume â€“ it draws the reader's attention to your strengths. It serves as a personalized introduction to generate further interest in your resume. A cover letter answers the question: What makes YOU the most suitable candidate for the job?</p>

            </ul>

            </ul>
